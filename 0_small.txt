Carrie Fisher once gave a Hollywood producer a cow's tongue after learning he had assaulted her friend.

Heather Ross, who works in the film industry, told Fisher about how the unnamed producer assaulted her in his car.

Fisher reacted by personally delivering the cow tongue in a Tiffany box wrapped in a bow to his office in Los Angeles.
